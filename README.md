# Cover Letter Site

This is a minimal Vue-based site for a personal cover letter. It uses Vue via CDN and can be deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Local Preview
Open `index.html` in a browser to see the page. Use the **dark mode** button to
switch themes and the **contact toggle** to reveal contact details.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Push the contents of this repository to GitHub.
2. In the repository settings, enable **GitHub Pages** and select the `main` branch (or the branch you use) as the source.
3. Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.

You can customize the contents in `main.js` and the style in `style.css`.

## Development
This project follows **Trunk-Based Development**. All changes are integrated
directly into the `main` branch in small, incremental commits.
