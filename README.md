# Cover Letter Site

This is a minimal Vue-based site for a personal cover letter. It uses Vue via CDN and can be deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Local Preview
Open `index.html` in a browser to see the page. The site automatically matches
your operating system's light or dark mode. You can also use the **dark mode**
button to switch themes manually and the **contact toggle** to reveal contact
details.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Push the contents of this repository to GitHub.
2. In the repository settings, enable **GitHub Pages** and select the `main` branch (or the branch you use) as the source.
3. Your site will be available at `https://chungchung234.github.io/cover_letter/`.

You can customize the contents in `main.js` and the style in `style.css`.
